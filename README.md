# WannaPlay

## Description
WannaPlay is a simple android application where you can group up with your friends for gaming. Simply get online on your smartphone and inform others that you are ready to play or check if someone is searching for a team.

**Project was cancelled cause of technical issues!**

## Used technology
Technology I used for this project:
* Java in AndroidStudio
* PHP
* MySQL

## How to use
This project is unfinished so to do anything worthy you need to download the whole branch and open the *AndroidStudio* project.

Latest *.apk* build you can find on this path *WannaPlay\app\build\outputs\apk\debug* but the database is down so you will not be able to enter!

Feel free to modify and reuse it for your projects!
